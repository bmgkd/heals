<p style = "font-size:21px"> Being a living being is one of the most challenging things we all face. Some days are easier than others, but it's important to recognize that every individual on this planet has a different life and is fighting their own battles. While it's understandable to feel like giving up at times, we must remember that achieving our dreams is what binds us all together. Problems and challenges are a part of life, but it's crucial to find solutions rather than giving up. Through this website, our goal is to provide a platform for depressed individuals to share their pain without fear of judgment and to showcase their talents. When I feel sad or hurt, I often turn to writing poetry or drawing, and I hope this website can serve as an outlet for others to do the same.It is crucial to raise awareness and establish a strongly supportive environment for individuals battling depression. This will empower them to open up and develop the resilience needed to overcome their struggles.<br>
